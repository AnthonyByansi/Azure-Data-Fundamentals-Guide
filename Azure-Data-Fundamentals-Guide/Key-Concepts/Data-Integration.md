# Data Integration in Azure ðŸ”—

Welcome to the Data Integration section of the Azure Data Fundamentals Guide! ðŸŒŸ In this section, we will explore the various data integration techniques and services available in Azure.

## Introduction to Data Integration

Data integration involves combining data from different sources, transforming it into a unified format, and making it available for analysis and decision-making. Azure provides a comprehensive set of services and tools to enable seamless data integration across various platforms, applications, and systems.

## Key Data Integration Services in Azure

Here are some of the key data integration services available in Azure:

ðŸ”„ **Azure Data Factory**: A fully managed, serverless data integration service that enables you to orchestrate and automate data movement and transformation across various sources and destinations.

ðŸ”— **Azure Logic Apps**: A cloud-based service that allows you to build and orchestrate workflows to integrate data and processes across different systems and services.

ðŸ§© **Azure API Management**: A service that helps you publish, manage, secure, and analyze APIs, allowing you to integrate data and services through APIs.

ðŸ’» **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute service that lets you execute code in response to events or triggers, making it suitable for lightweight data integration tasks.

## Azure Data Integration Workflow

Understanding the workflow of data integration in Azure can help you design efficient and scalable data pipelines. The following Mermaid diagram depicts the typical data integration flow:
