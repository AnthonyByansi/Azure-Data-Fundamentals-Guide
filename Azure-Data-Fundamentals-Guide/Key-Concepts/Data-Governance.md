# Data Governance in Azure 🛡️

Welcome to the Data Governance section of the Azure Data Fundamentals Guide! 🌟 In this section, we will explore the key principles, practices, and tools for implementing effective data governance in Azure.

## Introduction to Data Governance

Data governance refers to the management of data assets within an organization, ensuring data quality, security, compliance, and privacy. Azure provides a comprehensive set of services and capabilities to help you establish robust data governance practices and protect your data assets.
